## Prework Study Guide

A study guide for pre-work study purposes.

- My motivation was wanting to learn new things and improve my knowledge.
- I build this project as a guide for beginning and future learning.
- It solves basic problems like: what HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git are and what they are used for by introducing them.
- I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and how to connect them all. It also included debugging and little steps towards bigger projects!
