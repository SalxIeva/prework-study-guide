## Decsription
A study guide for study pre-work.

My motivation was wanting to learn new things and improve my knowledge.
I build this project as a guide for beginning and fututre learning.
It solves basic problems like: what HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git are and what they are used for by introducing to them.
I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git and how to connect them all. It also included debugging and little steps towards bigger projects!
